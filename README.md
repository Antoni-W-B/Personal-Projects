# Personal Projects

This repository represents some of the projects I have been working on over the past two years. The projects listed numerically in the repository include:

1.	My thesis on weak nuclear force simulations, with the accompanying code in Mathematica. The code demonstrates a solver that finds solutions to a set of complex partial differential equations, where the values of several input parameters keep changing. This allows us to simulate the value of the systematic error in the weak force measurement. This is an example of a quantum mechanical simulation. The code needs to be run in Mathematica to be displayed properly.
2.	A theoretical paper on graphene and the behavior of its electrons caused by grapheneâ€™s hexagonal lattice structure. The structure gives rise to quantum mechanical properties that can be appreciated macroscopically. The paper sets out to explain these properties using a simplified mathematical model. 
3.	A journal article demonstrating a set of experiments which could be used in undergraduate instruction to investigate interactions between radiation and matter. The article is not meant to be published, but has been subject to internal peer review. 
4.	A set of experimental physics projects. The experiments have been performed as part of the PHYS 21100 class at the University of Chicago, but have since been expanded upon. Topics of these projects includes Brownian motion, positron emission tomography, and Compton scattering.
5.	A set of jupyter notebooks demonstrating some of the work I have done at HELIX and gravitational wave research.
6.	Sample C++ code, meant to be uploaded to a featherboard (Arduino board) that controls a car around a maze. This was part of an engineering project.
7.	Sample code from the financial mathematics program. Includes some simple matching engines.
